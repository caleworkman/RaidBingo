## Description
A simple bingo game to be played inside the retail version of World of Warcraft.

## Setup Instructions
1. Click Clone or Download (top right area)
2. Download and unzip
3. Add the entire RaidBingo folder to: ...\\World of Warcraft\\\_retail\_\\Interface\\AddOns

## Customizing the Squares
Eventually I will add a way to do this in game
1. Strings.lua
2. Add to strings_generic
3. Escape any quotes or apostrophes (i.e. the word "can't" becomes "can\\\'t")
