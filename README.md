# WOW Raid Bingo

## Instructions
1. Clone or Download 
2. Download ZIP
3. Rename to RaidBingo
4. Add folder to: ...\\World of Warcraft\\\_retail\_\\Interface\\AddOns

## Customizing the Squares
Eventually I will add a way to do this in game
1. Strings.lua
2. Add to strings_generic
3. Escape any quotes or apostrophes (i.e. the word "can't" becomes "can\\\'t")


## Notes
1. You have to do /reload to reset the board
2. It does not save between sessions, so logging out will reset it.
